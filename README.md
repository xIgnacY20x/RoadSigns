# Traffic Sign Classification using DCNN
This project focuses on building and training a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to classify traffic signs from images. The dataset preparation, model architecture, training process, and evaluation are all included in the notebook.

# Project Highlights
Model Architecture: Custom DCNN built using Keras/TensorFlow.
Dataset: Images of various traffic signs, preprocessed and augmented for improved performance.
Training Pipeline:
Image preprocessing and normalization
Data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator
Model training with validation
Evaluation: Accuracy scores and visualizations of model performance
Inference: Making predictions on new images

# Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow & Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV (for image handling)

# Results
The model achieves good classification accuracy on the test dataset and demonstrates solid generalization thanks to data augmentation and architectural tuning.
